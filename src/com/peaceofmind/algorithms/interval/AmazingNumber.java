/**
 * Amazing number : It's value is less than or equal to its index.
 * Given a circular array, find the starting position such that the
 * total number of amazing numbers in the array is maximized.
 * Example 1: 0, 1, 2, 3
 * Output: 0, When starting point at position 0, all the elements
 * in the array are equal to the index. So all the numbers are amazing number
 * Example 2: 1, 0, 0
 * Output 1: When starting point at position 1, the array becomes 0, 0, 1. All
 * the elements are amazing number
 * If there are multiple positions return the smallest one.
 * Expected time complexit O(n^2)
